eMMC flashing using SDCard

1) Download the latest Debian OS
2) Write the bootable image to the SD Card first
3) Boot the board from SD Card
4) Execute the eMMC flasher script
5) eMMC flasher script will flash all the contents of the SD Card on to the eMMC memory



- Script will first divide the eMMC memory into two partitions called BOOT and ROOTFS
- Then it will format the partitions to create file system FAT and EXT4 respectively
- Then copies the images to the partitions

Command to check the debian version on BBB:
$ lsb_relese -da


- Download the latest debian image (compressed) file from http://beagleboard.org/latest-images
- Extract it to get the image
- Copy it to the SDCard (sudo dd if=/path/to/.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 ---- takes around 15 mins
- Unmount and insert the SD Card again.
- Edit boot/uEnv.txt to uncomment the following line:
	#cmdline=init=/opt/scripts/tools/eMMC/init-eMMC-flasher-v3.sh
- Save and unmount
- Take out the SDCard and inset to BBB
- Press S2 while giving power so that it boots from SDCard
- Once it boots, it starts flashing the image to eMMC on its own. ---- takes around 20 mins with max time spent to create rootfs
- Once its over, it shuts down power.
- Remove the SDCard and boot normally(no S2) from eMMC. Done!
