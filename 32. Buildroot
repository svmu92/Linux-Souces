Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded Linux systems through cross-compilation.

Can handle everything - Cross-compilation toolchain, root filesystem generation, kernel image compilation and bootloader compilation.

Thanks to its kernel-like menuconfig, gconfig and xconfig configuration interfaces, building a basic system with Buildroot is easy and typically takes 15-30 minutes.
