-transferring the boot images from HOST PC to the board via serial port(UART) in order to boot the board.
- protocols we can use include:
	Xmodem
	Ymodem
	Zmodem
	Kermit etc.
-We have to keep SPL,U-boot, linux kernel image, DTB and the file system on the host PC.

-Booting from UART
 When S2 is pressed, boot order is SPIO--->MMC0--->USB0--->UART0
 When no image is found in first 3 sources, it checks for UART0

-USB0 is P4 - mini USB cable, so dont use that, give power using adapter (explained in TRM - USB boot)
Errata Note: The system is delayed upto 4.5 minutes before continuing to next boot device if an attempt to boot from Ethernet fails for any reason.

-Peripheral booting
The ROM code can boot from three different peripheral interfaces.
	EMAC:1000/100/10Mbps Ethernet,using standardTCP/IP network boot protocols BOOTP and TFTP
	USB:Full speed,clientmode
	UART:115.2Kbps,8 bits, no parity,1 stop bit, no flow control

-UART boot procedure
Device Initialization
	UART boot uses UART0.
	UART0 is configured to run at 115200 baud,8-bits,no parity,1 stop bit and no flow control.
Boot Image Download
	UART boot uses x-modem client protocol to receive the bootimage.
	








- Once SPL image is received, it is placed into the internal RAM of the SoC.
- executes SPL
- now it tries to get the third stage bootloader (U-boot) over UART0 using Xmodem protocol.
- when u-boot executes, we can use u-boot commands such as xmodem or ymodem to load rest of the images like linux kernel image, DTB, initramfs into the DDR memory of the board at recommended addresses.



-Recommended addresses
Kernel (uImage)	-	0x82000000
DTB		-	0x88000000
Initramfs	-	0x88080000


Steps
1) Power on the board with S2 pressed, no SDCard and no USB Cable
2) Transfer spl
3) Transfer uboot.img
4) Press space to get into uboot prompt
=>loadx 0x82000000
	- transfer uImage file
5)
=>loadx 0x88000000
	- transfer DTB file
6)
=>loadx 0x88080000
	- transfer initramfs file
7) 
=>setenv bootargs console=ttyO0,115200 root=/dev/ram0 rw initrd=0x88080000

8)bootm ${kernel_load_address} ${initramfs_load_address} ${dtb_load_address}
=>bootm 0x82000000 0x88080000 0x88000000
