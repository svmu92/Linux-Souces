-U-Boot Environment variables
- set to standard as well as user defined environmental variables
- can store commands as value

-#printenv variable
-#setenv variable 'value'


-run <environment variable>
 will run a environment variable having some commands as its value
 eg: 	run bootcmd
	run findfdt
	
uEnv.txt contains collection of various environment variables set to different commands and automating command execution

- #boot
 - runs "bootcmd" environmental variables
 - command tries to load kernel and execute it

#bootm 
 - boot from memory


-U-boot always try to read uEnv.txt from the boot source, if not found, it will use the default values of the environmental variables
- It first reads and loads the Linux kernel to DDR memory
- Then it reads and loads the DTB to DDR memory
- Executes Linux kernel


#fatload
 -To load a file from FAT based file system to memory
 -eg: #fatload usb 0:1 0x82000000 uImage
 -eg: #fatload mmc 0:1 0x88000000 initramfs
 -Usage: fatload <interface> [<dev[:part]> [<addr> [<filename> [bytes[pos]]]]]


#load
 -To load a file from any file system
 -eg: #load mmc 0:1 0x88000000 uImage
 -Usage: load <interface> [<dev[:part]> [<addr> [<filename> [bytes[pos]]]]]


Step1
Load the linux kernel image to the DDR m/y from eMMC.
#load mmc 1:2 0x82000000 /boot/uImage 

vmlinuz-4.14.108-ti-r113

Step2
Load the device tree binary to the DDR m/y from eMMC
#load mmc 1:2 0x88000000 /boot/am335x-boneblack.dtb

#bootm 0x82000000 - 0x88000000


-BBB uses UART0 as the serial debug terminal which is enumerated as /dev/ttyO0 by the serial driver
-Root filesystem is present in partition2, if that info is not given, we will get log message kernel panic


Step3
Send bootargs to the linux kernel from U-boot
"bootargs" - env variable
#setenv bootargs console=ttyO0,115200 rootfs=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw


Automating the boot process using uEnv.txt

U-boot's serial port transfer protocols commands
1) loadx - send/receive file using xmodem protocol
2) loady - send/receive file using ymodem protocol
3) loadz - 

#loady
