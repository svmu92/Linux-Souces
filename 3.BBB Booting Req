4 software components to run Linux on BBB

1. RBL 		- Runs out of ROM
2. SPL/MLO	- Runs out of internal SRAM
3. U-boot	- Runs out of DDR (SDRAM)
4. Linux Kernel	- Runs out of DDR (SDRAM)
5. RFS		- Runs on SDCard/eMMC/Flash/Network/RAM



Three stage booting
	

RBL - ROM Boot Loader
-Very first piece of code to run on the SOC when you supply the power.
-Tiny piece of code
-Written by the vendor (TI)
-Stored in ROM during production of this chip
-Cannot change
-Source Code not available
-Major job is to load and run the second stage boot loader such as SPL or MLO from the internal memory of SoC


SPL - Secondary Program Loader or MLO - Memory Loader
-Job is to load and execute the third stage boot loader such as U-boot from the DDR memory


U-boot
-third stage bootloader
-job is to load and execute Linux kernel from the DDR memory
